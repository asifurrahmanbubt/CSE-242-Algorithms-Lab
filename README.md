## Binary Search

**Description:** Implementation of the Binary Search algorithm, which finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.

## Selection Sort

**Description:** Implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm, which sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.

## Insertion Sort

**Description:** Implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm, which builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

## Merge Sort

**Description:** Implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm, which is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together.

## QuickSort (Pivot as the First Element)

**Description:** Implementation of the QuickSort algorithm with the pivot element as the first element of the array.

## QuickSort (Pivot as the Last Element)

**Description:** Implementation of the QuickSort algorithm with the pivot element as the last element of the array.

## Median Removal

**Description:** Takes a list of integers and, whenever `-1` is given as input, outputs and removes the median of the list. The process stops when `0` is given.

## Fractional Knapsack

**Description:** Implementation of the Fractional Knapsack problem to maximize the total value in the knapsack.

## Activity Selection

**Description:** Implementation of the Activity Selection problem, which finds the maximum number of activities that don't overlap.

## Max Heap Sort

**Description:** Implementation of the Heap Sort algorithm using a max heap.

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

**Description:** Implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.

## Huffman Coding

**Description:** Implementation of Huffman Coding, a lossless data compression algorithm.

## Prim's Algorithm

**Description:** Implementation of Prim's Algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph.

## Kruskal's Algorithm

**Description:** Implementation of Kruskal's Algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph.

## Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Description:** Implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.

## Bellman-Ford Algorithm

**Description:** Implementation of the Bellman-Ford Algorithm for finding the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
